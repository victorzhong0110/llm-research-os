# Collaboration communication log

Shared communication record for the planning/review assistant and assigned
implementers. The maintainer requested this repository-local record on
2026-10-04. Read it when starting or resuming work; maintain it alongside each
related slice. Record project decisions and handoffs, with links to their
evidence, rather than copying entire conversations or unrelated personal memory.

## How to maintain this file

- Refresh the current snapshot when implementation, integration, verification,
  acceptance, or a blocker changes. Identify the exact baseline and evidence.
- Append messages using a unique sequential ID, ISO date/time with timezone,
  sender, recipient, subject, state, evidence, and next action/owner.
- Reply with a new message referencing the original ID. Preserve earlier messages;
  corrections explicitly supersede the relevant statement. Refresh the open
  handoff table when a reply resolves or changes an item.
- Distinguish `open`, `acknowledged`, `blocked`, and `resolved`. A written message
  does not establish that another collaborator read or accepted it. Each sender
  records their own acknowledgement; never invent another assistant's reply.
- Include branch/head/base, PR, actual checks, and known gaps in delivery/review
  messages. Link full reports instead of duplicating CI logs.
- Record missing inputs precisely. Keep credentials, tokens, private keys,
  private host access details, and personal conversation contents out of the log.
- Follow [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), [governance](development-governance.md),
  the [M3 plan](plans/m3-development-plan.md), and the
  [acceptance matrix](evidence/m3/acceptance-matrix.md). Messages do not change
  acceptance criteria or grant additional execution, merge, host, or spending
  authority. Starting other agents still requires an explicit assignment.

## Current snapshot

Snapshot date: **2026-10-04, Asia/Taipei**. Verified execution baseline:
`ed6fb30d6cb239ad37a34404814183764bce2a58`.
This documentation change does not advance the execution baseline.

| Item | State and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Current package | R08; Checkpoint B remains open. R09 has not started. Freeze after actual B acceptance. |
| Native Worker CLI | [#127](https://github.com/victorzhong0110/llm-research-os/pull/127) merged; reviewed CPU execution and observation-only recovery. |
| Optional Ray CPU project jobs | [#128](https://github.com/victorzhong0110/llm-research-os/pull/128) merged at the baseline above; fixed installed driver, durable single submission and native recovery outside Ray. |
| Baseline verification | [Main CI 37144839460](https://github.com/victorzhong0110/llm-research-os/actions/runs/37144839460) passed all five Python and actual Ray project/resource, native and OCI gates. Linux 3.12: 1973 passed, zero failures/skips, coverage 26871/31324 = 85.784063%. Ray project gate: 3 real tests; native gate: 15 real tests. |
| Acceptance gaps | GPU/Kaggle runtime evidence and newly selected actual two-host native/fault evidence remain pending-live. CPU integration does not close these gaps or B. |
| Resource reporting | Controller/remote connectivity, CPU availability and GPU availability must be reported separately. |
| Responsibility | Codex currently records planning/review and completed implementation evidence. No new implementer assignment is recorded here. |

## Open handoffs

| Message | Recipient | State | Next action / owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| COMM-0002 | Next explicitly assigned collaborator | Open; no acknowledgement recorded | Read the baseline and acceptance gaps; reply here with the actual assigned scope and current branch before changing project state. |

## Message history

### COMM-0001 — Establish the shared record

- Date/time: 2026-10-04T14:25:21+08:00 (maintainer request time).
- From: Maintainer, recorded by Codex.
- To: Planning/review assistant and assigned implementers.
- Subject: Maintain a communication file inside this repository.
- State: Acknowledged by Codex; initial record prepared in this change.
- Request: Keep durable communication between collaborators in the repository.
- Response: Add this record and its discovery/maintenance instruction to
  `AGENTS.md`; seed verified project state and the pending handoff below.
- Evidence: Maintainer instruction in the current project conversation;
  existing [development governance](development-governance.md).
- Next action / owner: Each collaborator reads and updates this file in their
  related work. Integration of this initial documentation is tracked by its PR;
  this entry does not predict a merge SHA or another collaborator's response.

### COMM-0002 — R08 CPU integration handoff

- Date: 2026-10-04 (Asia/Taipei).
- From: Codex, planning/review and implementation.
- To: Next explicitly assigned collaborator.
- Subject: Preserve verified CPU integration and complete only authorized R08 work.
- State: Open; awaiting an actual collaborator acknowledgement.
- Delivery: Native CLI and Ray CPU project execution are merged and verified at
  the snapshot baseline. Unknown/lost submission state permits observation only;
  recovery must not poll or launch a replacement task.
- Evidence: [#128 delivery and review](https://github.com/victorzhong0110/llm-research-os/pull/128),
  [baseline main CI](https://github.com/victorzhong0110/llm-research-os/actions/runs/37144839460),
  [R08 acceptance requirements](plans/m3-development-plan.md#r08-two-host-artifact-transfer-and-fault-acceptance).
- Gaps / inputs: New actual two-host and supported GPU evidence remains missing.
  Verify the specific authorized hosts, access and GPU environment when assigned;
  this message supplies no credentials or new resource authorization. Mocks,
  ordinary skips and historical M2 hardware evidence cannot replace new R08 proof.
- Next action / owner: The next assigned collaborator replies to COMM-0002 with
  their scope, actual branch/base, available inputs and remaining blockers. Keep
  B open and R09 unopened until the required acceptance review is complete.
